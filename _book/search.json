Testing can find defects thought check . testing help us weed poor quality code makes future bugs harder find fix.turns code review excellent complement testing. Studies shown code review can find 60% defects (McConnell 2014), unit testing finding 25%. two techniques work well partnership: automated testing relatively cheap run, can run repeatedly without needing (much) human intervention. Code review expensive, requires human effort time performed, can find wider range defects. good workflow therefore make sure bugs detected code review converted test cases, can detected cheaply future versions code, valuable code review effort can put towards finding new defects currently covered code base. course, maximum efficiency, requires code review ever performed code already passes test suite.Code review advantages well, helping homogenise improve coding styles across teams, spread knowledge code base evenly throughout team. code reviewed least one person, days parts code untouchable anyone except lone expert created gone team’s truck factor increased7. human nature code carefully correctly know one colleagues looking code push team repository.important aware costs code review, well, however. Code review takes time. Typical code review rates 100 200 lines code per hour, experienced professionals (Kemerer Paulk 2009; Bisant Lyle 1989).
