## Work Breakdown Structures {#wbs}

Estimating how long something will take is often a challenging task and why many estimates like the one in figure \@ref(fig:xkcd-estimation-fig) are not accurate. Its important to be able to justify any estimates you make, rather than just making a vague guess.

One technique for improving the accuracy (and justifiably) of your estimates is called Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) which is explained in the video in figure \@ref(fig:wbs-video-fig).

```{r wbs-video-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionestimationvid)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cost-estimation-video.png")
```

(ref:captionestimationvid) Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) will help to improve the accuracy and justifiability of your cost estimations in software engineering. The image in the picture is a screenshot, to watch the full seven minute video at [youtu.be/tKCfnF-z2hY](https://youtu.be/tKCfnF-z2hY)

For example, in stendhal, lets say you needed to estimate the cost if fixing a bug about players losing health points between 5.00am and 7.00am in the morning. This is `100%` of your task that you could break this down into several sub-tasks follows:

1. Replicate the bug (`20%`)
1. Fix the bug (`20%`)
1. Check that the bug is really fixed (`20%`)
1. Push the bug fix to the repository (`20%`)
1. Make sure the same bug doesn’t exist elsewhere (`20%`)

You could break each step down further into sub-sub-tasks

1. Replicate the bug  (`20%`)
    1. Replicate the bug manually (`5%`)
    1. Gather missing info from reporter (`5%`)
    1. Find tests for this or similar functionality  (`5%`)
    1. Write test that reveals the bug (`5%`)

We've split the tasks evenly here, though in practice you would probably give them different percentages depending on the size and difficulty of the tasks.
