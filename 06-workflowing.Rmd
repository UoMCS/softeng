# Git workflows {#flowing}

There are several workflows you can use in git, figure \@ref(fig:xkcd-git-fig) should not be one of them.

```{r xkcd-git-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "55%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionxkcdgit)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git.png")
```

(ref:captionxkcdgit) Deleting your project and downloading a fresh copy is not the best workflow. [Git (xkcd.com/1597)](https://xkcd.com/1597/) by [Randall Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe) is licensed under [CC BY-NC 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)
