# Welcome {.unnumbered #welcome}

Welcome to (ref:coursecode): [software engineering at the University of Manchester](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP23311/syllabus/).

## Making better software {#better}

The development of software systems is a challenging process. Customers expect reliable and easy to use software to be developed within a set budget and to a tight deadline. As we come to depend upon software in so many aspects of our lives, its increasing size and complexity, together with more demanding users, means the consequences of failure are increasingly severe. The stakes for today’s software engineers are high!

```

(ref:openingcaption) Course unit roadmap. This twelve week course will take you from small scale code changes (shown in grey), through to working with features (shown in orange) and on to larger-scale change (shown in yellow). We finish with an open source challenge in chapter \@ref(opening). The skills you will develop on this course are fundamental to modern software engineering.

Experience over the last few decades has taught us that software development failures are rarely caused by small scale coding problems. Instead, failures result from the difficulties of writing software that customers actually need, of keeping up with constantly changing requirements, of coping with the scale of large developments, of getting many different people with very different skill sets to work together, and of working with large bodies of existing code that no one on your team may fully understand. Being a good coder is an important part of being a good software engineer, but there are many other skills - including soft skills - that are needed too.

In this course unit, you will get the chance to expand and broaden the programming skills you gained in your first year course units by applying them in a more realistic context than is possible in a small scale lab, see figure \@ref(fig:course-overview-fig). Instead of coding from scratch, you will be working in a team to make changes to a large open source software system, consisting of thousands of classes and tens of thousands of files - and all without breaking the existing functionality.

You will fix bugs in the codebase and add new features, as well as performing larger scale refactorings to maintain or improve on non-functionality properties of the system. You will perform all this using an industry strength tool set. We will complement the hands-on experience-based learning with an understanding of the core concepts underlying current notions of software engineering best practice. Volunteer mentors from local industry will help you to put your learning into context, and to understand the key importance of being not just a good coder, but a good software engineer.

This course unit detail provides the framework for delivery in 20/21 and may be subject to change due to any additional Covid-19 impact. Please see Blackboard / course unit related emails for any further updates.

## Aims {#bilo}

This unit aims to help students appreciate the reality of team-based software development in an industrial environment, with customer needs, budget constraints and delivery schedules to be met. Through hands-on experience with an industry-strength development toolkit applied to a large open source software system, students will gain an appreciation of the challenges of green and brownfield software development, along with an understanding of the core software engineering concepts that underpin current best practice. Students will have the core skill set needed by a practicing software engineer, and will be ready to become productive and valuable members of any modern software team.

### Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this unit, a student will be able to:

* make use of industry standard tools for version management, issue tracking, automated build, unit testing, code quality management, code review and continuous integration.
* write unit tests to reveal a bug or describe a new feature to be added to a system, using a test-first coding approach.
* explain the value of code reviews, and to write constructive and helpful reviews of code written by others.
* make use of basic Git workflows to coordinate parallel development on a code base and to maintain the quality of code scheduled for release.
* explain the role of software patterns (design and architectural) in creating large code bases that will be maintainable over the long term.
* explain why code that is easy to test is easy to maintain, and make use of test code smells in identifying and correcting design flaws (design for testability)
* apply basic software refactorings to maintain or improve code quality
* explain the challenges inherent in cost estimation for software development, and create defensible estimates with the help of work breakdown structures

## Using the lab manual {#usingit}
We expect that the web-based version of this manual will be the one you'll use most at [software-eng.netlify.app](https://software-eng.netlify.app/). You can search, browse and link to anything in the manual. It was last updated on `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`.

However, if you'd prefer, the manual is also available as a single pdf file [softeng.pdf](https://software-eng.netlify.app/softeng.pdf) and an epub as well [softeng.epub](https://software-eng.netlify.app/softeng.epub). Having said that, the content is optimised for viewing in a web browser, so while the pdf and epub are OK, the web version is the best.

## Contributing to this manual {#contributing}
If you'd like to contribute this laboratory manual, we welcome constructive feedback. Once you're familiar with git and markdown you can [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and:

* Raise new issues at [github.com/dullhunk/softeng/issues/new](https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng/issues/new)
* Click on the `Edit this page` link, which appears on the bottom right hand side of every page published at [software-eng.netlify.app](https://software-eng.netlify.app) when viewed with a reasonably large screen (not a phone)
* Contribute at [github.com/dullhunk/softeng/contribute](https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng/contribute) and help with existing issues at [github.com/dullhunk/softeng/issues](https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng/issues)
* Fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request [github.com/dullhunk/softeng/pulls](https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng/pulls). If you need to brush-up on your pulling skills see [makeapullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
* From the command line, clone the repository and submit pull requests from your own setup:
````md
git clone https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng.git
````
Most of the guidebook is generated from [RMarkdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), that's [all the `*.Rmd` files](https://github.com/dullhunk/softeng/search?l=RMarkdown). So markdown files are the only ones you should need to edit because everything else is generated from them including the `*.html`, `*.tex`, `*.pdf` and `*.epub` files.
